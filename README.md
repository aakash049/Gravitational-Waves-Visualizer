# Gravitational-Waves-Visualizer
#### A Simple python script to visualize the Gravitational Waves detected by the `Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)` just 100 years after the Einsteinâ€™s paper on their prediction. 
##### The data sets contain 32 secs of data sampled at 4096Hz an 16384Hz around the GW event detected on 14/09/2015.
